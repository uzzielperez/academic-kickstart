Uzziel Perez is a Postdoctoral Researcher at La Salle Campus, Barcelona. Their research interests include the use of AI models to reconstruct particles, real-time analysis, Standard Model Precision Measurements and Searches for Exotic Physics. In lay terms, they are interested in seeing if our current understanding of what makes "us" and the universe up is accurate in their predictions. They use time-tested analysis tools to do research and are exploring new techniques such as using neural networks to infer and gain new insights from the data collected from the LHCb detector (and formerly CMS, one of the general-purpose detectors) in the Large Hadron Collider. On their free time, they hiking mountains, finding unexplored paths, generating new AI and programming tools for startups and writing about science, nature, being human, comedy and everything else that they find interesting.
