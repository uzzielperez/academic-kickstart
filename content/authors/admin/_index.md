Uzziel Perez is a Graduate Research Assistant at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Alabama. They are based at CERN. Their research interests include Standard Model Precision Measurements, Machine Learning for Particle Physics and Searches for Exotic Physics. In lay terms, they are interested in seeing if our current understanding of what makes "us" and the universe up is accurate in their predictions. They use time-tested analysis tools to do research and are exploring new techniques such as using neural networks to infer and gain new insights from the data collected from the CMS detector, one of the general-purpose detectors in the Large Hadron Collider. On their free time, they like to hike mountains, find unexplored paths, and write about science, nature, being human, comedy and everything else that they find interesting.
